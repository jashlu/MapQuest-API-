# MapQuest-API-


#This program describes a trip taken between a sequence of locations, the goal being to travel from the first location to the second, then from the second location to the third, and so on, until reaching the last location. 

Based on the user's input, it will show different information about the trip, such as turn-by-turn directions, distances and times, etc.

There are 5 different information options you can choose to view for each search. The five are 

  1. STEPS for step-by-step directions, meaning a brief description of each maneuver (e.g., a turn, entering or exiting a           freeway, etc.) you would have to make to drive from one location to another
  2. TOTALDISTANCE for the total distance traveled if completing the entire trip
  3. TOTALTIME for the total estimated time to complete the entire trip
  4. LATLONG for the latitude and longitude of each of the locations specified in the input
  5. ELEVATION for the elevation, in feet, of each of the locations specified in the input
